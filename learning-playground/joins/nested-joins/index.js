// Does using the smaller table for the outer loop or inner matter affect performance?
// Yes, imagine this:
const enrollment_table = [
  {id: 0, student_id:0, course: 'Anatomy'},
  {id: 1, student_id:1, name: 'Biology'},
  {id: 1, student_id:0, name: 'Cooking'},

// We would need to loop on the outside 3 times, instead of 2 as before
// On the third run, we would need to iterate the entire students table again

//‚ùì‚ùì It's always wise to do the math calculation. Will the Query planner choose the lesser expensive operations, or does the way we order our join matter‚ùì‚ùì






// Read a page into memory from Table1, then scan Table2
// instead of reading individual rows of table1, we read a blocks, then scan it 1 block at a time on S
// were doing the old algorithm IN MEMORY, this is how we deal with not being to load everything in memeory.
// IMPROVEMENTS:
//  üõë reminder, your here to build intuition not build your own production DBMS from scratch
//  - factor of 100 improvements covered in video.....
//  - Better to do read in of multiple blocks to memoery, since we can afford it VS 1 at a time
